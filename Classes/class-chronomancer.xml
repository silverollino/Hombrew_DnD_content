    <description>
      <p>Existence is measured in age. How many years has a mortal lived? What was the construction date of the walled city of Ambrosia? When were the deities formed? Time begins at birth, at creation. But, inevitably, time for all things comes to an end.</p>
      <p class="indent">Except, of course, for time itself.</p>
      <p class="indent">Bearer of the clock of eternity, rimmed by signs of the Zodiac, the chronomancer counts every tick of the second hand, preventing interference with that essential ever flowing forward momentum.</p>
      <h4>RELEVANCE OF TIME</h4>
      <p>Chronomancers gain their magical potency directly from time itself - harnessing the energies of flowing time, and manipulating them to suit their gain.</p>
      <p class="indent">It is a most dangerous tradition, as the practice of slowing, reversing, or diverting the flow of time can accidently tear novices to pieces, spreading them thinly across millennia, or sometimes even drop them wholesale into a new or old era, with no way of returning home.</p>
      <p class="indent">Masters, however, walk the generations as planeswalkers walk the cosmos. Experienced chronomancers can reliably and literally end most conflicts before th most conflicts before they even begin.</p>
      <p class="indent">Chronomancers typically learn to control their powers through an eternity of studies, usually under the guidance of an older mentor. However there is no greater test than altering reality. Many aspiring chronomancers test their newly honed powers by changing the outcome of a significant event by travelling through different timelines to craft the most favored result.</p>
      <h4>CREATING A Chronomancer </h4>
      <p>As you build your chronomancer, think about when and why your character pursued the ebband flow of time. Did the thought of changing a significant event in the past plague you as a young adult and it was not until you matured that you realised bending time was the best way to correct the wron to correct the wrong-doing you had done? Maybe you were cursed with these powers by a demon, forced to endure visions of a million possible ways for your closest friend to die every night, only relieiving you of the curse if you craft the best possible outcome.</p>
      <p class="indent">Consider how your character perceives their abilities. Do abilities. Do you view them as a punishment for a wrong-doing from a long time ago? Or maybe view them as gift from your deity to protect and assist those around you.</p>
      <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
      <p>You can make a chronomancer quickly by following these suggestions. Firstly, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution &amp; Intelligence. Secondly, choose the Sage background. Thirdly, take the cantrips <i>Prestidigitation</i>, <i>Bolt of Prestidigitation</i>, <i>Bolt of Time</i>.</p>
      <p class="indent">Along with the following 1st level spells: <i>Magic Missile</i> and <i>Feather Fall</i></p>

    <description>
      <p>As a conduit of the ebb and flow of time, you can cast chronomancer spells. See chapter 10 of the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and you can see the specific chronomancer spell lists at the end of this document.</p>
      <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
      <p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Chronomancer spell list. You learn additional Chronomancer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Chronomancer table.</p>
      <h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
      <p>The Chronomancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p>You prepare the list of Chronomancer spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of Chronomancer spells from your spellbook equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Chronomancer level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
      <p>For example, if you’re a 3rd-level Chronomancer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
      <p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Chronomancer spells requires time spent studyingthe ebb and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
      <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for chronomancer spells, since the power of your magic relies of your eternal studies of time. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a chronomancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
      </p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
      <p>You are attuned with your gaming set and use it as a spellcasting focus for your chronomancer spells</p>
      <h5>LEARNING SPELLS OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
      <p>Each time you gain a Chronomancer level, you can add two Chronomancer spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Chronomancer table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).</p>

  <element name="Wheel of time" type="Class Feature" source="Zst0rm" id="ID_ZSTORM_REDDIT_CLASS_FEATURE_CHRONOMANCER_WHEEL_OF_TIME">
    <description>
      <p>At 2nd level your studies allow you to spin the wheel of time to alter the fate of yourself, an ally or an enemy. Your access to this bend in time is represented by fate dice. You have fate dice equal To your proficiency bonus + half of your chronomancer level (rounding down). For example a 2nd level chronomancer has 3 fate dice, whereas a 9th level chronomancer has 8 fate dice.</p>
      <p>You can expend fate dice for a variety of uses. You know how to bend time to do the following: Accelerate, Decelerate and Surge.</p>
      <p>When you expend fate dice, it is unavailable until you finish a long rest at which point you regain all expended fate dice by rewinding the wheel of time.</p>
      <p>Some of your Wheel of Time features may require your target to make a saving throw to resist the features effects. The saving throw is your spell save DC which you can calculate in the Spellcasting Ability section previously.</p>
      <h6>Accelerate</h6>
      <p class="indent">As a bonus action you can expend a fate dice to hasten a targets actions and do multiple actions on the targets next turn. You roll 1d4 and the target gains additional actions equal to the result. You cannot use any of these extra actions for Accelerate or Surge. You can use this once per long rest. At 9th level you can use this twice per long rest, and at 18th level you can use Accelerate 3 times per long rest.</p>
      <h6>Decelerate</h6>
      <p class="indent">As a reaction to being damaged by an enemy you can delay the wounds inflicted by expending a fate dice. fate dice. You roll 1d4 and do not take the damage that would of been inflicted for that amount of rounds. The creature damaging you can make a Wisdom saving throw to ignore the effect and break the bend in time.</p>
      <p>For example, you roll a 3 and do not take the damage until 3 rounds has passed. This includes the round where the round where you used Decelerate.</p>
      <h6>Surge</h6>
      <p class="indent">As an action you can expend a fate dice to take an additional action in the next round. You cannot use this additional action to cast any spell of 4th-level or higher. The action gained by surge cannot be used for Surge again.</p>
