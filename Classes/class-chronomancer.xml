    <description>
      <p>Existence is measured in age. How many years has a mortal lived? What was the construction date of the walled city of Ambrosia? When were the deities formed? Time begins at birth, at creation. But, inevitably, time for all things comes to an end.</p>
      <p class="indent">Except, of course, for time itself.</p>
      <p class="indent">Bearer of the clock of eternity, rimmed by signs of the Zodiac, the chronomancer counts every tick of the second hand, preventing interference with that essential ever flowing forward momentum.</p>
      <h4>RELEVANCE OF TIME</h4>
      <p>Chronomancers gain their magical potency directly from time itself - harnessing the energies of flowing time, and manipulating them to suit their gain.</p>
      <p class="indent">It is a most dangerous tradition, as the practice of slowing, reversing, or diverting the flow of time can accidently tear novices to pieces, spreading them thinly across millennia, or sometimes even drop them wholesale into a new or old era, with no way of returning home.</p>
      <p class="indent">Masters, however, walk the generations as planeswalkers walk the cosmos. Experienced chronomancers can reliably and literally end most conflicts before th most conflicts before they even begin.</p>
      <p class="indent">Chronomancers typically learn to control their powers through an eternity of studies, usually under the guidance of an older mentor. However there is no greater test than altering reality. Many aspiring chronomancers test their newly honed powers by changing the outcome of a significant event by travelling through different timelines to craft the most favored result.</p>
      <h4>CREATING A Chronomancer </h4>
      <p>As you build your chronomancer, think about when and why your character pursued the ebband flow of time. Did the thought of changing a significant event in the past plague you as a young adult and it was not until you matured that you realised bending time was the best way to correct the wron to correct the wrong-doing you had done? Maybe you were cursed with these powers by a demon, forced to endure visions of a million possible ways for your closest friend to die every night, only relieiving you of the curse if you craft the best possible outcome.</p>
      <p class="indent">Consider how your character perceives their abilities. Do abilities. Do you view them as a punishment for a wrong-doing from a long time ago? Or maybe view them as gift from your deity to protect and assist those around you.</p>
      <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
      <p>You can make a chronomancer quickly by following these suggestions. Firstly, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution &amp; Intelligence. Secondly, choose the Sage background. Thirdly, take the cantrips <i>Prestidigitation</i>, <i>Bolt of Prestidigitation</i>, <i>Bolt of Time</i>. 
      <p class="indent">Along with the following 1st level spells: <i>Magic Missile</i> and <i>Feather Fall</i>

    <description>
      <p>As a conduit of the ebb and flow of time, you can cast chronomancer spells. See chapter 10 of the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and you can see the specific chronomancer spell lists at the end of this document.</p>
      <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
      <p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Chronomancer spell list. You learn additional Chronomancer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Chronomancer table.</p>
      <h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
      <p>The Chronomancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p>You prepare the list of Chronomancer spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of Chronomancer spells from your spellbook equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Chronomancer level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
      <p>For example, if you’re a 3rd-level Chronomancer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
      <p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Chronomancer spells requires time spent studyingthe ebb and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
      <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for chronomancer spells, since the power of your magic relies of your eternal studies of time. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a chronomancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
      </p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
      <p>You are attuned with your gaming set and use it as a spellcasting focus for your chronomancer spells</p>
      <h5>LEARNING SPELLS OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
      <p>Each time you gain a Chronomancer level, you can add two Chronomancer spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Chronomancer table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).</p>

    <description>
      <p>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Chronomancer level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>
      <p>For example, if you’re a 4th-level Chronomancer, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>

    <description>
      <p>The study of Chronomancerry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>
      <p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Chronomancers through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even Chronomancers who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>
      
      <p>When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools, such as Evocation.</p>
      <p>Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>

The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Chronomancer spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. On a successful save, you can’t use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest.</description>

    <p>At 10th level, you add the polymorph spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast polymorph without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower.</p>
    <p class="indent">Once you cast polymorph in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.</p>

    <p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter’s stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter’s stone is destroyed and can’t be remade until you finish a long rest.</p>
    <p class="indent"><span class="feature">Major Transformation.</span>You can transmute one nonmagical object—no larger than a 5-foot cube—into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.</p>
    <p class="indent"><span class="feature">Panacea.</span>You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter’s stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.</p>
    <p class="indent"><span class="feature">Restore Life.</span>You cast the raise dead spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter’s stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.</p>
    <p class="indent"><span class="feature">Restore Youth.</span>You touch the transmuter’s stone to a willing creature, and that creature’s apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn’t extend the creature’s lifespan.</p>
